			<h3>Our Re-Sodding Process</h3>
			<b>Grass Removal</b>
			<p>The first step is to remove the old grass. We use a sod cutter that cuts the grass out under the surface at the roots. Next we pick up all that old unwanted grass and/or weeds. We use shovels and wheel barrows on small to average sized lawns and a skid steer on large lawns. We put it all into a dump trailer or dump tuck depending on the size of the lawn. Once every ounce of evidence of the old lawn is gone it’s time to prepare the site for new sod.</p>
			<br>
			<b>Soil & Grading</b>
			<p>To prepare for new sod we add approximately 3” of fresh, screened, residential top soil. We maintain a proper grade that adheres to any city approved drainage plans and to ensure that water runs away from the foundation of the house. If the current grade needs to be corrected we will add or remove extra soil where needed. Once we have established a proper grade and the soil is even and flat with no bumps or valleys, we compact the soil using a lawn roller and then re-rake to loosen the soil. The site preparation step is most important because it is the base the lawn will be living on for years to come, improper grading can lead to foundation issues and/or a wet basement. Unevenness in the lawn makes mowing difficult and can cause extra wear and tear on your lawn mower. If you’re doing the work yourself, take great care here.</p>
			<br>
			<b>Laying Sod</b>
			<p>Laying the sod requires great attention to detail. We lay the rolls parallel to the road or back fence and stagger the joints. We take great care to make sure that there are no gaps between the sod pieces so they grow together quickly.</p>
			<br>
			<b>Finishing Touches</b>
			<p>We precisely cut any pieces that need to be trimmed. The last step is to roll the sod with the lawn roller, this compresses the soil further and helps the new sod mesh with the soil. </p>

			<h3>Watering</h3>
			<b>When</b>
			<p>Begin watering new sod within a half hour after it is laid. Apply 1 to 2 inches of water so that the soil 
			beneath the sod is very wet. Ideally, the soil 3 to 4 inches below the surface should be moist.</p>
			<br>
			<p>After the 1st heavy soaking continue to water the lawn every day in the 1st week after installation. After the 1st week you can back off the watering a bit to every 2nd day. Water every second day for a week or 2 and if the lawn still looks green you can back off again to a couple of times per week.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Adjust the amount of water you’re applying depending on the weather conditions. In the cooler temperatures of spring and fall apply ½ inch per day but in July and August 1” per day will likely be the best way to go. Also adjust the amount of water you apply depending on how much it rains. Always water in the morning or at night to avoid water loss by evaporation.</p>

			<b>How</b>
			<p><b>Watering Tip #1:</b> To measure the amount of water you’re applying put down a few  containers (tuna cans are a popular choice) on different spots of the lawn, before you turn on the sprinkler(s). Some containers will gather more water than others so wait until on average, they have collected the desired amount of water. </p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Watering Tip #2:</b> Pull back a corner of the sod and push a screwdriver or other sharp tool into the soil. It should push in easily and have moisture along the first 3 or 4 inches, or you need to apply more water.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Watering Tip #3:</b> Make absolutely certain that water is getting to all areas of your new lawn, regardless of the type of sprinkler system you use. Corners and edges are easily missed by many sprinklers and are particularly vulnerable to drying out faster than the center portion of your lawn. Also, areas near buildings dry-out faster because of reflected heat and may require more water.  </p>
